# ADR 003: Propagation of Proposed Values

## Changelog

* 2025-03-04: Context and proposed values propagation Alternatives

## Context

> This section contains all the context one needs to understand the current state, and why there is a problem. It should be as succinct as possible and introduce the high level idea behind the solution.

Malachite implements a consensus algorithm, [Tendermint][consensus-spec],
that receives as input, for each instance or height of consensus,
a number of proposed values and should output a single decided value,
among the proposed ones.

There is no assumptions regarding what a **value** is or represents:
its semantics is defined by whatever software uses consensus to propose and
decide values, which from now on we generically refer to as the *application*.
For example, blockchain applications provide as input to consensus blocks to be
appended to the blockchain.

This ADR is motivated by the fact that a consensus algorithm should actually
implement two main roles:

- **Value Propagation**: proposed values should be transmitted to all consensus
  processes;
- **Value Decision**: a single value, among the possibly multiple proposed
  values, must be decided.

As discussed in the [Value Propagation](#value-propagation) section,
this role tends to be the most expensive, in terms of latency and bandwidth
consumption, of the algorithm.
The [Tendermint](#tendermint) section discusses how these roles are implemented
by Tendermint; readers familiar with the algorithm may skip it.

### Tendermint

Tendermint implements both the **Value Propagation** and **Value Decision** roles.
Its [pseudo-code][consensus-code], however, reveals that there is already an
abstract distinction between the two roles.
More specifically, Tendermint is organized into heights and rounds; each round
has three round steps (`propose`, `prevote`, and `precommit`), each round step
having an associated message type:

- `PROPOSAL` messages carry a proposed value `v` and its main role is of
  **Value Propagation**.
  They are referred to as [**proposals**][consensus-proposals] and are
  broadcast by the `proposer` of a round in the `propose` round step;
- `PREVOTE` and `PRECOMMIT` messages carry an identifier `id(v)` of a proposed
  value `v`, or the special value `nil` meaning "no value", and play the role
  of **Value Decision**.
  They are referred to as [**votes**][consensus-votes], and are broadcast by
  all processes, respectively, in the `prevote` and `precommit` round steps.

Note that `PROPOSAL` messages have also a role on **Value Decision**, as they
carry consensus-related fields that are validated by processes and have
implications in the algorithm.
The point is that they are the only messages with **Value Dissemination** role,
so that the `propose` round step is where the dissemination of values takes
place.

A second remark is that if a vote issued by a process carries `id(v)`, then the
process must have received a `PROPOSAL` message carrying value `v`.
In other words, the **Value Decision** stage of a round can only succeed in
deciding a value `v` if the associated **Value Propagation** stage has also
been successful in delivering the proposed value `v` to all (correct) processes.

In fact, every state-transition predicate in the [pseudo-code][consensus-code]
that may lead to a successful round of consensus, i.e. to the decision of a
value `v`, requires the **Value Propagation** stage to have been successful,
that is, includes the condition:

```
XX: upon ⟨PROPOSAL, h_p, r, v, vr⟩ from proposer(h_p, r)
```

where `h_p` is current height of consensus process `p`, `r` is a round
(typically `p`'s current round `round_p`), and `vr` is a previous valid round
number `vr < r`, which is only relevant during the `propose` round step.

### Value Propagation

The propagation of proposed values in Tendermint happens in the first step, the
`propose` step, of a consensus round.
The `proposer` of the round selects a value `v` to propose and includes it in a
`PROPOSAL` message that is send to every process.
In the ordinary case, the proposed value is the input for the process,
retrieved via the `getValue()` function ([pseudo-code][consensus-code] line 18).

The propagation latency for the `PROPOSAL` message is directly associated to
the byte size of the proposed value `v`.
This is in contrast with the other consensus messages, `PREVOTE` and
`PRECOMMIT`, that carry an identifier `id(v)` of a proposed value `v`,
that is expected to be smaller than `v` and essentially fixed size.
As a result, the latency of the `prevote` and `precommit` round steps should be
fairly constant.

Thus, as proposed values `v` get larger, the `propose` step becomes the most
expensive of a consensus round.
It is therefore natural to devise strategies to render the implementation of
the **Value Propagation** role more efficient.

Here it is important to notice that the
[High Level Architecture for Tendermint Consensus Implementation (ADR 001)][adr001]
already enables the use of distinct protocols
for the broadcast of [proposals][consensus-proposals] or `PROPOSAL` messages,
that propagate potentially _large_ (variable-size) proposed values `v`,
and for the broadcast of [votes][consensus-votes],
the generic name for `PREVOTE` and `PRECOMMIT` messages,
carrying _small_ (fixed-size) value identifiers `id(v)`:

```rust
/// Output of the round state machine.
pub enum Output<Ctx>
    where Ctx: Context,
{
    // Several fields ommitted

    /// Broadcast the proposal.
    Proposal(Ctx::Proposal),

    /// Broadcast the vote.
    Vote(Ctx::Vote),
}
```

In the same [ADR 001][adr001], are defined the corresponding inputs to the
consensus state-machine implementation.
The `ProposeValue` input provides the proposed value `v` for a round,
namely the return of the `getValue()` function.
The `Proposal` input represents the reception of a proposal,
carrying  a proposed value `v`.
And the `Vote` input represents the reception of a vote,
carrying an identifier `id(v)` of a proposed value `v`
(or the special value `nil`, meaning "no value"):

```rust
pub enum Input<Ctx>
    where Ctx: Context,
{
    // Several fields ommitted

    /// Propose a value for the given round
    ProposeValue(Round, Ctx::Value),

    /// Receive a proposal, of the given validity
    Proposal(Ctx::Proposal, Validity),

    /// Receive a vote
    Vote(Vote<Ctx>),
}
```

The issues that this ADR is meant to address are mainly two:

1. The fact that [ADR 001][adr001] is not any longer in line with the implementation;
2. The ways that applications, given Malachite consensus' interface, handle the
   propagation of proposed values.

The [Alternatives](#alternatives) section below overviews and discusses some
approaches to handle **Value Propagation** efficiently.

## Alternatives

This section presents a (possibly not comprehensive) list of approaches to
handle **Value Propagation** for consensus protocols in general, and for
Tendermint in particular, discussing the pros and cons of each of them.

### Consensus by Value

In this approach, the consensus implementation play both the
**Value Propagation** and **Value Decision** roles.


### Consensus by Reference

In this approach, the consensus implementation plays only the
**Value Decision** role.
The application is responsible for implementing the **Value Propagation** role.

## Decision

> This section explains all of the details of the proposed solution, including implementation details.
It should also describe affects / corollary items that may need to be changed as a part of this.
If the proposed change will be large, please also indicate a way to do the change to maximize ease of review.
(e.g. the optimal split of things to do between separate PR's)

## Status

> A decision may be "proposed" if it hasn't been agreed upon yet, or "accepted" once it is agreed upon. If a later ADR changes or reverses a decision, it may be marked as "deprecated" or "superseded" with a reference to its replacement.

Proposed

## Consequences

> This section describes the consequences, after applying the decision. All consequences should be summarized here, not just the "positive" ones.
