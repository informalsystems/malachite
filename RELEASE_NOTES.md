## 0.5.0

- Update libp2p to v0.56.x ([#1124](https://github.com/informalsystems/malachite/pull/1124))
- Rename `Effect::RebroadcastVote` to `Effect::RepublishVote` and `Effect::RebroadcastRoundCertificate` to `Effect::RepublishRoundCertificate` ([#1011](https://github.com/informalsystems/malachite/issues/1011))
- Decouple `Host` messages from the `Consensus` actor ([#1109](https://github.com/informalsystems/malachite/pull/1109))
- Fix a bug where values synced from other peers were assigned the current node's address instead of their proposer's address ([#1141](https://github.com/informalsystems/malachite/pull/1141))
- Buffer sync values for heights higher than current height in consensus and replay when running consensus for those heights ([#1149](https://github.com/informalsystems/malachite/pull/1149))
- Add value batching to sync messages ([#1070](https://github.com/informalsystems/malachite/issues/1070))

## 0.4.0

*July 8th, 2025*

- Add parallel requests for the sync module ([#1092](https://github.com/informalsystems/malachite/issues/1092))

## 0.3.1

*July 7th, 2025*

- Derive [Borsh](https://borsh.io) encoding for all core types, behind a `borsh` feature flag ([#1098](https://github.com/informalsystems/malachite/pull/1098))

- When the sync module receives an invalid commit certificate from another peer, it will now drop the associated synced value altogether instead of passing it up to the application ([#1112](https://github.com/informalsystems/malachite/pull/1112))

## 0.3.0

*June 17th, 2025*

- Removed the VoteSet synchronization protocol, as it is neither required nor sufficient for liveness ([#998](https://github.com/informalsystems/malachite/issues/998))
- Reply to `GetValidatorSet` is now optional ([#990](https://github.com/informalsystems/malachite/issues/990))
- Clarify and improve the application handling of multiple proposals for same height and round ([#833](https://github.com/informalsystems/malachite/issues/833))
- Prune votes and polka certificates that are from lower rounds than node's `locked_round` ([#1019](https://github.com/informalsystems/malachite/issues/1019))
- Add support for making progress in the presence of equivocating proposals ([#1018](https://github.com/informalsystems/malachite/issues/1018))

### Resources

- [The tutorial][tutorial] for building a simple application on top of Malachite using the high-level channel-based API.
- [ADR 003][adr-003] describes the architecture adopted in Malachite for handling the propagation of proposed values.
- [ADR 004][adr-004] describes the coroutine effect system used in Malachite.
  It is relevant if you are interested in building your own engine on top of the core consensus implementation of Malachite.

## 0.0.1

*December 19, 2024*

First open-source release of Malachite.
This initial version provides the foundational consensus implementation but is not recommended for production use.
